# <Brandon-Wing's-Module-2-Challenge>

## Description

The project this week was to build a website from scratch that acts as a portfolio of my full-stack development work as well as contact information. It will serve as an important resource for potential employers when I begin to apply for jobs.
I tried my hardest to figure it out using resources from class and from the internet, but I have still struggled to develop a clean page where all the elements behave correctly. Much practice is required.
